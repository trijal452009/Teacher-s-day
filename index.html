<h1>Happy Teacher's Day </h1>    
<p> Happy teacher day to my favorite teachers The light of the world, the beacon in the dark and the hope that gives us strength to survive, is our teacher. Today we celebrate Teachers' Day. A day, kept aside to honour the gifted souls who work everyday to make sure that the future is bright for all of us. Let us welcome all the teachers with a big round of applause.
